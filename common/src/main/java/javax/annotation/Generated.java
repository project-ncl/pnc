/**
 * The Generated annotation is used to mark source code that has been generated.
 * It can also be used to differentiate user written code from generated code
 * in a single file. When used, the value element must have the name of the
 * code generator. The recommended convention is to use the fully qualified
 * name of the code generator in the value field .
 * <p>For example: com.company.package.classname.
 * The date element is used to indicate the date the source was generated.
 * The date element must follow the ISO 8601 standard. For example the date
 * element would have the following value 2001-07-04T12:08:56.235-0700
 * which represents 2001-07-04 12:08:56 local time in the U.S. Pacific
 * Time time zone.</p>
 * <p>The comment element is a place holder for any comments that the code
 * generator may want to include in the generated code.</p>

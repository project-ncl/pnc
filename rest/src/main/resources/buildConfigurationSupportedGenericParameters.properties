EXECUTION_ROOT_NAME=Specify the execution root name of the build configuration. This is used to override the default value, and can be useful for builds that disable PME. Format is '<groupid>:<artifactid>'
CUSTOM_PROJECT_MANIPULATOR_PARAMETERS=Additional parameters, which will be passed to the Project Manipulator CLI executable during the alignment (NPM, etc, non-Maven projects) before the build. The format is as you would enter them on a command line, and each MUST start with a dash.
EXTRA_PUBLIC_REPOSITORIES=Allows to specify any public repositories, which will be used to proxy build dependencies. Format is a single URL per line.

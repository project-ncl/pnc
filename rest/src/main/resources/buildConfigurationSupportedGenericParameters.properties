CUSTOM_PME_PARAMETERS=Additional parameters, which will be passed to the PME CLI executable during the alignment before the build. The format is as you would enter them on a command line, and each MUST start with a dash.
EXECUTION_ROOT_NAME=Specify the execution root name of the build configuration. This is used to override the default value, and can be useful for builds that disable PME. Format is '<groupid>:<artifactid>'
